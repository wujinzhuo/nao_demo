# Local Testing: OIDC Authentication with Okta

This guide walks through manually testing the OIDC SSO feature end-to-end using Okta as the identity provider against a local development instance.

## Prerequisites

- A running local nao instance (`npm run dev`)
- An Okta developer account ([developer.okta.com](https://developer.okta.com))
- A valid Enterprise Edition license with the `sso` feature, or an equivalent dev-time bypass

## 1. Create an Okta Application

1. Sign in to the **Okta Admin Console**
2. Navigate to **Applications** → **Create App Integration**
3. Select **OIDC - OpenID Connect** and **Web Application**, then click **Next**
4. Configure the application:
    - **App integration name**: `nao-local` (or any name)
    - **Grant type**: Authorization Code
    - **Sign-in redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/oauth2/callback/okta`
    - **Sign-out redirect URIs**: `http://localhost:3000`
    - **Controlled access**: Allow everyone in your organization (or assign specific users/groups)
5. Click **Save**, then copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### Show the App on the Okta Dashboard

Optional — only needed to test launching nao from Okta's **My Apps** page.

1. In the application's **General Settings**, click **Edit**
2. Set **Login initiated by** to **Either Okta or App**
3. Check **Display application icon to users**
4. Set **Initiate login URI** to `http://localhost:3000/api/sso/start`
5. Click **Save**

Clicking the tile then redirects to `/api/sso/start`, which starts the OAuth flow server-side and sends the browser to Okta — the nao login page is never rendered. Without this URI, Okta lands the user on `/login` instead.

If **Assignments** is locked with "This app is implicitly assigned to users", the app has **Federation Broker Mode** enabled. Disable it under **General** → **Federation Broker Mode** to assign users manually, or manage access through the app's sign-on policy instead.

### Enable PKCE

In the application settings, under **General Settings** → **Client Credentials**, ensure that **Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)** is enabled. This is the recommended configuration and matches `OIDC_PKCE=true` in the nao `.env`.

### Find the Discovery URL

1. Go to **Security** → **API** → **Authorization Servers**
2. Copy the **Issuer URI** for the `default` authorization server (e.g., `https://dev-xxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/default`)
3. Append `/.well-known/openid-configuration` to form the full discovery URL

### Configure the Authorization Server Access Policy

Okta has two separate policy layers — the **Authentication Policy** (controls login) and the **Authorization Server Access Policy** (controls token issuance). Both must allow access for the OAuth flow to complete.

1. Go to **Security** → **API** → **Authorization Servers** → select the `default` server
2. Open the **Access Policies** tab
3. If no policy exists, create one:
    - Click **Add Policy**, give it a name (e.g., `Default Policy`), and assign it to **All clients**
    - Click **Add Rule** inside the policy, name it (e.g., `Default Rule`), and keep the default settings (allow all grant types, all scopes)
4. Click **Save**

Without an access policy, Okta will authenticate the user but refuse to issue tokens, resulting in a "not allowed to access this app" error after login.

### Assign Users

Make sure the test users are assigned to the application:

1. Go to **Applications** → select your app → **Assignments** tab
2. Click **Assign** → **Assign to People** and add the users you want to test with

## 2. Configure nao Environment

Add the following to your `.env` file at the repository root:

```env
OIDC_PROVIDER_ID=okta
OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=Okta
OIDC_DISCOVERY_URL=https://dev-xxxxx.okta.com/oauth2/default/.well-known/openid-configuration
OIDC_CLIENT_ID=<your-client-id>
OIDC_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-client-secret>
OIDC_SCOPES=openid,profile,email
OIDC_PKCE=true
```

Replace the placeholder values with the ones from your Okta application.

## 3. Run the Test

1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open `http://localhost:3000/login` in a browser
3. A **"Continue with Okta"** button should appear on the login page
4. Click it — you should be redirected to the Okta login page
5. Authenticate with your Okta credentials
6. After successful authentication, you should be redirected back to nao and logged in

To test the Okta-initiated flow, open the **My Apps** dashboard and click the `nao-local` tile. You should land in nao already signed in, without seeing the login page.

## 4. Verify User Roles

nao assigns the **admin** role to the very first user created in the system. All subsequent users are created with the **user** role.

To verify this behavior:

1. **First user**: Log in via Okta with the first test account. Confirm the user is created with the `admin` role (visible in the settings/admin panel).
2. **Second user**: Log out, then log in via Okta with a different test account. Confirm this user is created with the `user` role.

This matches the standard nao behavior — the first-user-is-admin rule applies regardless of the authentication method.

| `redirect_uri_mismatch`                             | Redirect URI in Okta doesn't match `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/oauth2/callback/okta` exactly                     |
| "User is not assigned to the client application"    | Test user not assigned to the Okta app (see **Assign Users** above)                                                  |
| "You are not allowed to access this app"            | Missing Access Policy on the authorization server (see **Configure the Authorization Server Access Policy**)         |
| TLS certificate errors in logs                      | Corporate proxy or self-signed certs — configure `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` or equivalent for your runtime                |
| Login succeeds but user can't see projects          | Expected — an admin must add the user to a project after first login                                                 |
| App tile opens the login page instead of signing in | **Initiate login URI** not set to `http://localhost:3000/api/sso/start` (see **Show the App on the Okta Dashboard**) |
| App does not appear on the **My Apps** page         | **Display application icon to users** unchecked, user not assigned, or Federation Broker Mode enabled                |
